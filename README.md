## My process

### What I learned

The main purpose of this challenge was to get acquainted with setting up my own solo projects, using GitHub and pushing projects live.

I have been working for 1.5 years as a Frontend developer, working in a pretty specific environment where I am not using GitHub. I felt quite rusty with such workflows, so I thought it was time to refresh my memory. I somehow messed up my initial commit, which reminded me that I should first and foremost create a new repository before getting into the nitty-gritty of the code.

The other purpose is to simply "get out there", show my code to more people, and receive more feedback. I especially want to make sure I'm continuously building good practices in my coding.

I did not encounter many difficulties with the challenge in itself and strived to get as close to the mock-up as possible.

### Useful resources

- [Adjusting SVG to full view width](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9185434/using-svg-as-background-image) - This helped me understand how to make sure my svg element would take the whole width page, and not keep a max width of 1440px.
